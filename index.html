                        Our team name meaning: In spite of standing out by containing only numbers,
                        our team name has a special meaning behind those. Moreover, this name represents our spirit,
                        working attitude, and tight-knit solidarity. Although we are still newbies in the transition
                        from high school and we came from different educational systems, we all share the same thing
                        that we are willing to work nine-to-five and discuss overtime to come up with the best possible result.
                        By doing that, we can amend our weaknesses, thrive on our strengths as a team and we can be well-prepared
                        for work and life. Besides, if each digit in our team name is added together, it will become the time when
                        every member in our team has heard of the terms coding, programming, and Information Technology. Since then,
                        we all have had the same goal of having a job relevant to Information Technology.

For Ngoc as a front-end developer, she will use tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as foundation. Thach as a data analytics has Microsoft Excel, SQL, Tableau, Python in his arsenals. Thong as IT system manager and Luan as project manager will have similar skill sets as a manager, the understanding of programming and the ability to code and communication skills between teams, other managers, and higher ups. Even when we have different roles in the IT profession, we all have to use data to complete a task. Front end developers work on the website’s and application’s UI, what the user sees is the product of the developer, and use the feedback data of the user and tester for improvement. Data analyst works on big data, uses it to analyse, constructs graphs or charts to visualize it and find solutions, he is the core key for organisations to decide on the future. IT systems and project managers work on teams and make sure everything meets the quality, cooperate with other managers, use data to figure out and discuss with the executives to be cost efficient. The difference is IT manager ensures all the software and hardware function, secure and up to date, while project manager is ensuring teams working on the projects meet the deadline and stay motivated. </p>

To start, Luan will open a project and list out all the requirements and deadlines to meet. Thong will ensure all the equipment and database are ready for use, also create security against data leaking. Thach will have access to big data and analyze for the team to use, interpret the data and visualize for the team uses, his analysis is the key for the team success. Ngoc will be the forefront developer of the system UI and back-end work so the customer can see the product or the information given by the team. </p>

His department, ZingPlay Game Studio, currently works on 15 games, and Nhan is in charge of 2 games in the server service aspect. Nhan also talks about Vietnam's market for gaming and what is required to do if the company wants to extend the game service to other countries. When we asked him about who he’s working with, he told us he associated with his PM to take the task and understand where the game will head. After understanding what he needs to do, Nhan will cooperate with the artist and game designers, sometimes even the business developer for collecting data, and show the pair or trio working process between front-end and back-end developer. We asked about his biggest work, he told us that he works <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">on making bots for games to create an assumption from the user that his game has a lot of active players. The second task is to upgrade his department's framework for future plans since it has been outdated for five years. This is also the biggest challenge for him because he wants the framework to be more capable and has many features. After we listened to the massive workload he has to work, we asked what he does when he needs to relax. He responded that VNG has a campus that provides a gym and swimming pool to workout, and during the weekend he plays basketball. For the last technical question we asked about the similarity of his work to other IT professionals. He said the common thing between all of IT is the need of collecting data and constantly debugging a program. Lastly, we asked for some tips for any newcomers into the field. He told us to understand clearly all the fundamentals and try to have an internship in our second year. Overall our interview went well, we have learned so many new things from him and are truly grateful to have him as our guest.

And, more importantly, he did the assigned tasks excellently and on time. This makes me feel admired and proud to be a part of a team with such an engaged and proactive member.
                                <br><br><b>Myself:</b> As a team leader, I think I have done my job quite well, including assigning work to members, arranging meetings with interviewees, creating prototypes and websites, and supporting other members when needed. Overall, I am pleased with the level of effort I have put in to help the team's overall success. Nevertheless, as this is my first time as a leader, many things are still new and confusing to me, but the team members always make me feel like I chose the right team since they are constantly enthusiastic and passionate about the work I assign to them and always make me feel like we are friends, not teammates. That makes me very delighted, and it drives me to keep studying so that I can bring many desired accomplishments to my beloved group.

Although she has a significantly rich background in web-designing aspects, she is very humble and willing to listen to the rest of the team. In addition, she is the most proactive member of my team because she is the one who always gives great support to others. Besides, Ngoc is very <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">sociable with a great social network, so our team can have an experienced IT professional for the interview. It is my pleasure collaborating with Ngoc and I feel very lucky to have her on my team.
                                    <br><br><b>Doan Khanh Luan:</b> Luan is a very collaborative teammate with a wide range of soft skills and he is always assiduous with his work. When working with reports, he always shows great responsibility and puts a lot of effort into coming up with the most convincing version. Additionally, Luan also reflects on being an experienced interviewer. During the interview, Luan made it look so simple and natural with a lot of interactions with the interviewee which was the IT professional. Thanks to Luan, I can gain more experience and learn more when it comes to interviews.
                                    <br><br><b>Pham Hoang Thong:</b> Thong is an immeasurably passionate teammate with a high sense of responsibility. Although Thong had to be self-isolated for a few weeks because of being positive to COVID-19, he is very proactive and he is always the first person to respond to our questions via our group chat on social media. Not only that but Thong also provides a lot of ideas and puts great effort into his work which is tasks related to videos and the team profile. I had a deep impression of his work since Thong used to study in the United States for a few years, so his work looks very professional.
                                    <br><br><b>Myself:</b> I considered myself to be the least knowledgeable person in my team since I am the only one in my team having studied in Vietnamese public high school and I had neither a lot of great soft skills nor great social network like my teammates in high school. However, I am a diligent, studious, and meticulous person, so collaborating with Ngoc, Luan and Thong gave me a great opportunity to enrich my knowledge as well as expand my social network. In this assignment, I have tried my best to accomplish my parts as well as support and contribute to my team’s work. For the next assignment, I will make myself learn more, enhance my working efficiency and come up with better ideas so that our group project can be more comprehensive and I can also amend my weaknesses.

I was impressed with his working style and that is the reason why I look up to him. Right after the tasks was allocated for team members, Thach immediately get to work with his assignments. Even in discussion, he show no hesitation in the way he give out his idea. Thach also has a good skill <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">of writing and researching, which made him completed his task exceptionally. His hardworking attitude has sparked an inspiration in every team member, boosting the productivity of the club for the best outcome.

                                    <br><br><b>Duong Vu Thanh Ngoc:</b> Ngoc is the only girl in this group but she proved to everyone that the stereotype about girls in the IT industry is just a false accusation. In fact, she became our leader, guiding the whole team throughout the assignment with great attitude and leadership. Ngoc has shown her dedication and inspiration right from the start of the assignment, she completely impressed other team members with her project idea and even volunteered to be assigned into the hardest part of the project. I even noticed that she is also a meticulous person. Every part of the project that required a collaboration between members, she planned it well and prepared everything carefully before coming to the meeting, except that day when she forgot the camera set at home. I was grateful that I have a chance to work with a great leader like Ngoc who guided our project to a good outcome.
                                    <br><br><b>Pham Hoang Thong:</b> Thong has shown every members of the team that he is capable of doing every tasks assigned whether it is complex or simple. At the moment we started working on our assignment, Thong was diagnosed with COVID - 19. However, despite illness, he was able to complete every part of his assignment. Thong even join every discussions and meeting of our team even though the meeting was not conducted online. With being a student coming back from the US, Thong has shown his skill in English with great listening and writing skills. He has completed his job of writing the script and subtitled the recording of the interview marvelously. I was honored to meet and form up a team with a person with great personality like Thong.
                                    <br><br><b>Myself:</b> In this assignment, I have done my part well and some of it brought to our team valuable outcomes. Event though I have a decent speaking skill, I did not expect to complete the interview part well, but the final product from the interview was just as great. However, I also realized an amount of flaws that I have not fixed. One of the mistakes that I made during the assignment was that I had a bad time management. There was a lot of task that I have to done during the time as my houses are being fixed and I have to help my parents. But I think that I will have less pressure doing the assignment if I managed my time better so as not to make me running late on due date and slowing my teammates schedules down. Therefore, after this assignment, one of my priorities is to fixed my time management skills and practice taking more responsibility on the tasks assigned.

He always finds a way to make us laugh, which helps a lot during times when we have some kind of awkward silence to break the bubble. He is good with socializing and we had him to interview our IT professional and he did a quality job, crystal clear speaking and excellent questions for our guest. I’m happy to have Luan in my team. Without him, we probably do not have a lot of team meetings just for coffee.

The time I work with my teammates is valuable and educational, I learn and find a lot of my weaknesses in group working but they help me to improve. I am happy that I found members and friends willing to help me and not judging me, but motivated to be better.

I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh City. I am currently a first-year student at RMIT University, and my student ID is s3924496. With a strong passion for technology, I am currently pursuing an Information Technology degree at this university. When it comes to languages, I am fluent in Vietnamese (my mother tongue) and English. In my leisure time, I like volunteering for charitable organizations. One of the charitable activities I have taken part in is the United Minds Mindlight Project, in which I taught English and life skills to visually impaired students at Nguyen Dinh Chieu school. Aside from that, I have celebrated a moon festival for the orphans at Mai Am Anh Sang (District 3, HCMC) and helped in delivering charity meals to the lonely disabled and homeless elderly in HCMC. Apart from my interest in charitable activities, I also love cooking and reading detective books. About my high school background, I used to be a loyal member of the school's Robotics Club, and I was also joining many web-designing classes. Thanks to that, I was able to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS and became interested in the job of Front-end Developer. Beyond that, I have also created a website using WordPress. (Here is my website link: https://snuffbox.000webhostapp.com [1]).</p>

In the near future, I intend to learn more about JavaScript by reading the documentation and using online resources such as Codecademy or Freecodecamp. To obtain additional experience, I plan to work on a side project, such as my online portfolio or website, or try freelancing and attend an internship to have a feel of the real working experience. My journey will undoubtedly be long and tough, but I am confident that if I keep on track, I will reach my destination.</p>

I am an RMIT freshman, my student ID is s3927021 and currently, I am studying for the Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born in Ho Chi Minh city, and I have been living here since. When it comes to languages, I can speak Vietnamese and English because those are compulsory languages in Vietnam’s educational program. However, I had learned Simplified Chinese for a few months before the first outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, I am an active person, so I love playing sports and playing basketball, swimming, and working out at the gym are my favorite ones. Furthermore, I love travelling, listening to V-pop and US-UK music to be more precise, and I love cooking. I find it very interesting to be creative in making my food. About pets, I would love to have a Siberian Husky and fishes as my pets because I find a Siberian Husky very cute, and watching the fishes swimming in the tank can be very relaxing and satisfying although I only have a fish tank at home currently and I hope to have a Siberian Husky soon. I find Data Science very intriguing in IT because data appears everywhere, and it plays a vital role in many enterprises. My interest in IT commenced when I was still a senior student in high school. After taking further research on Data Science, I made up my mind to choose my career as a Data Analyst to embark on after graduating from university. Although I am just a freshman and I have not had any professional or IT-related experience, I will do my best as a student. I am going to finish my study at RMIT University as a Bachelor of Information Technology with a minor in Data Analytics. During my study, I will join clubs, competitions, and online courses to gain relevant skills as well as to enrich my knowledge about Supply chain, Finance, Marketing, etc. Moreover, I will search for internships during that time so that I can gain as much real-life working experience as possible to get a job as a Data Analyst after graduating. </p>

Even though my ancestors are originated from China and my grandparents were born and raised in Dong Thap and Long Hai, I am 100% a Saigoneer as I have lived in Ho Chi Minh city from the young age. My friends always describe me as a funny and down-to-earth person, but I think it just because gravity pulled me down. I must say that I have a lot of skills in different field from sports to academic, however, due to the fact that I learned too much, I was never an expert in any aspects. Currently, I am practicing piano to add to my collection of “skills-that-no-one-admired” and also to fulfill my dream of playing my own favorite music instead of listening to it on the internet. </p>

When I was in grade 7, I got a chance to attend a summer camp in Singapore, which is a great experience of mine as I was able to acquired useful skills like English speaking or presentation skills. In 2020, I was selected to be in the robotic team, representing the Cong Hoa campus in the SIU Open technology competition. After two days of hard-working, our team won the third place in the competition.</p>

I have three dogs which were all white, one of them is the first ever dog that I owned as pet and it was a little bit grumpy towards the other two, my favorite one is the poodle because it is the only one that allow me to pick up. Another hobby of mine is video games, I have been playing mobile video games for most of my life, which is a waste of time as everyone knows that gaming on a computer is much better. </p>

I’ve graduated from Faith West Academy located in Texas, U.S. I have studied abroad in America for four years so I’m very much confident in my speaking skill. During the time in high school, I have been basketball team for one year, participated in school soccer teams for two years, ran for track and field in 100m dash, 400m dash in the first year, 300m hurdles for the second year, and finally, I was in the skeet shooting team for two years. In my free time, I’m quite investing in gaming, especially in the FPS genre (First Person Shooter). There was one time, when the first wave of the COVID-19 virus hit America, all the school switch to online classes, I was having a lot of times after finishing up homework and we couldn’t really go outside, so I sticked with the computer most of the times and grinding the game, to the point that I was in a semi-competitive environment with an actual team and working on strategy and review gameplay, etc. Other times I’ll watch anime or workout.My interest in IT sparked when I was watching a YouTuber named Joma Tech, he is also an ex data scientist for Facebook and software engineer at Google. He has a video which is called “What really is Data Scientist? Told by a Data Scientist”. He explained how data scientists originate from the history of data mining and how companies use big data to expand their possibility of growth, achievement, and optimization for consumers. I watched his video and found the job and the future of the information store in the network can make many different things. This gives me the inspiration to research more about software and IT professionals. During my time studying at RMIT, I expect to expand my knowledge in the IT world. Having to solve real world problems that I might encounter during my journey, develop discipline and techniques can lift myself up during challenging times. I hope I can learn more soft skills and hardware knowledge that will contribute to my profession. </p>

He is also the only person in the group who is a tactile learner, which is what he liked to learn by doing things hands on. His scatter personality will give the team a rough draft of ideas. </p>

                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 1. What does it do? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It is undeniable that privacy had been one of the most vital issues among people, businesses, and organizations even before the “digital big bang”. However, since the early days after the revolutionary invention of the computer and the arrival of the Internet, information security had become more important but more vulnerable and fragile since the information was transmitted to a digital platform instead of being in physical shape like before. Therefore, the term “Cybersecurity” had arrived, and it became the key to protecting and maintaining privacy, users’ assets, and classified information. In 2020, V. Michael and B. Ian noted in their book that cybersecurity covers a wide range of social and technical problems that must be taken into consideration to secure networked information systems and network privacy [1].  In addition, in 2021, according to A. Moallem, “Cybersecurity is a growing field of science composed of very diverse types of technologies used to protect systems from different kinds of attacks, some known and some unknown. Due to the complexity of the evolving aspects of these areas, there is no standard classification of protective technologies.” [2, p. 1].</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The traditional approach of security to protect computer systems and network systems like authentication devices, firewalls, and virtual private networks (VPN) has a lot of different kinds of vulnerabilities since cyberattacks nowadays have become more advanced and sophisticated and they can disrupt security programs and infiltrate systems [3]. In the upcoming years, it is critical and escalating compulsory for companies and organizations to deal with complexity since the sprawling increase of today’s network scale is inevitable and clear borders, access points will be eliminated; IT teams can reach the point of exhaustion from relentless sprint of protecting information; more importantly, the volume of data will rise dramatically, which can give cybercriminals more thing to exploit, and “complexity is the enemy of security” [4]. Therefore, different technologies must be applied and integrated to upgrade cybersecurity so that it can resist modern cyberattacks.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Nowadays, as technology is growing rapidly, many existing tools and technologies can be used to enhance cybersecurity. There are two ways of categorizing cybersecurity technologies. The first way is based on the components that each technology is supposed to protect which are network, application, endpoint, data, identity, database, infrastructure, mobile, cloud, and backup [2, p.25]. The second way is the solution-based classification including Identity and Access Management, Risk and Compliance Management, Encryption, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Unified Threat Management (UTM), Firewall, Antivirus/ Anti-malware Solutions, Intrusion Detection System (IDS)/ Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Disaster Recovery, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Mitigation and Web filtering [2, p. 25].</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Moreover, some specific technologies can be optimized for information protection. Firstly, data encryption is a very powerful way to protect confidential information from hackers. Moreover, this technology uses a symmetric-key algorithm and asymmetric-key algorithm such as Blowfish and RSA, respectively, to encode the sensitive data to meaningless language and this encoded data is only readable by the person having the decryption key [2, p. 30]. Secondly, biometric technology has developed significantly since it uses physical and behavioral traits which are permanent and unique for authentication, surveillance, and identification instead of conventional passwords, which is a very safe and reliable approach [2, p. 50]. Thirdly, firewall technology has been widely implemented in hardware and software from personal devices to large data systems in companies and organizations. In detail, a firewall is a network security system designed to monitor traffic to and from a computer or computer network and to block traffic that does not comply with security parameters in place so that it can protect a computer or computer network from cyberattacks [5]. In addition, malware protection technology is indispensable due to the proliferation of smart technologies and malware can be a significant threat. For instance, there were a lot of infamous malware attacks in the past like Stuxnet Worm (2010), Backoff (2014), or WannaCry Ransomware (2017), etc [2, p. 102-103]. Therefore, anti-malware solutions must be constantly conducted to detect and prevent malware from stealing confidential information. Finally, as we are living in a world of expanding connectivity, the Internet of Things technology will be a great cybersecurity approach. Moreover, IoT technologies connect all devices and make them “smart” by connecting them to other devices in a network and “intelligent” by using machine learning and data science to manage and analyze real data to make decisions and predict future events [2, p. 116]. In the future, as newer technologies will be introduced and developed, cybersecurity will implement those latest technologies to protect data and information.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It is undeniable that cybersecurity will become an indispensable industry as the technology era continues to rise sharply. Thanks to cybersecurity, companies, organizations, or users, in general, will be more confident of information security and it may change how people think about information security. Furthermore, the concept of environmentalism will become ubiquitous among users since this is “a concept where humans believe in the responsibility to protect the planet and where norms of behavior have been established, nurtured, and generally followed.” [4, p. 284]. However, what we need in the technology era is “cyberspace environmentalism” [4, p. 284], which is a set of shared beliefs, norms, and shared experiences among people about the culture of security.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As a result, IT teams will not have to sprint endlessly to keep the data secured like before but then they have to come up with different approaches using a combination of different technologies like Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models and algorithms, etc to make cybersecurity systems more adaptive and keep the information systems safe from not only the old versions of cyberattacks but also the latest ones. According to Ken Xie, the CEO of Fortinet, “There is virtually no area of cybersecurity that won’t be transformed by AI and ML.” [4, p. 282] and Michael Xie, a president and the CTO of Fortinet, has claimed that “We must move from threat prevention to the greater challenge of securing hyperconnectivity.”</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As the cybersecurity industry will need to implement various technologies, a diversity of professions will be in demand. For instance, if Machine Learning is adopted into cybersecurity, it will create some jobs in the Machine Learning field that specializes in cybersecurity or there will be cooperating activities between many teams to come up with approaches using different technologies. As a result, not only the information and data will become more secure, but tight-knitted solidarity will be built among teams in a company or an organization. On the contrary, there will be some old technologies will no longer be the main efforts in protecting the data, but they will become a part of the latest cybersecurity systems.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 3. How will this affect you? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">From my perspective, not only cybersecurity helps large-scale companies and organizations, but it also makes daily users like me and my family more confident about information security. Although there will not be a lot of changes in the way I use technology since modern cybersecurity systems will be built inside of hardware and software. I must admit that I use technology every day mainly for educational and entertaining purposes and it is becoming an indispensable part of my daily life because of its diverse conveniences and benefits. Thanks to the latest versions of cybersecurity systems that implement various new technologies, I can feel more secure and confident using technology without worrying too much about whether my personal information will be leaked, or my devices will be hacked into.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">From my view of a technology daily user, there will be some major differences between the current cybersecurity systems and the newer ones in the future. I believe the newer versions can detect more malware, phishing, and threats in general although the current versions can only detect limited threats. As a result, I can have a more comfortable experience using technology or surfing the web since if there are any hidden threats detected during my usage, there will be warnings showing up and the cybersecurity systems will stop those threats. In addition, these newer versions of cybersecurity systems can be a significant assistant for my family members and friends, who do not have a deep interpretation of technology and threats, so they can lose their personal information without knowing it. Since the cybersecurity systems will be more adaptive, they can have a smoother experience using technology without being interrupted with malware or spam emails while working and entertaining, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and safety protocols must be followed, people can be more confident of their data security, and they can do their work from home more effectively.</p>

                                    <hr class="name_line" style = "height:8px">
                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/1.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 1. What does it do? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It has been more than a decade since the phrase “Internet of Things” was first described by Kevin Ashton, a co-founder and executive director of the Auto-ID center, to reduce human workload in 1999 [6]. According to F. Xia, L. T. Yang, L. Wang, and A. Vinel, the Internet of Things refer to the networked interconnection of everyday objects, which are often equipped with ubiquitous intelligence and it will increase the ubiquity of the Internet by integrating every object for interaction through embedded systems, which leads to a highly distributed network of devices communicating with human beings as well as other devices [7]. Since then, IoT has become the future trend that most technologies are being developed around it.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Nowadays, IoT has appeared everywhere from conventional industries like healthcare, education, industrial manufacturing to modern industries using cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, automation, and many more. The Internet of Things makes everything smarter and more helpful to our daily lives. For instance, recently, thanks to the Internet of Things, citizens can have a deeper understanding of the trend “smart homes” and they can experience it in person. In detail, smart homes, an application of IoT, are those where household devices can be monitored and controlled remotely, which can ease out the home automation task [8]. Moreover, “With the upcoming technologies like the IoT— both consumer and industrial— artificial intelligence, robotics, and evolving machine learning provides an open environment where potential business partners and their machines can collaborate and exchange information over a digitally connected network using cyber physical systems.” [9, p. 154].</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">During the COVID-19 pandemic and many safety protocols must be followed, the Internet of Things can be the key factor to make our lives better in the future. For example, there is a potential trend called “IoT-Based Smart Tourism” that can be applied to the reality that can help tourism to recover and rise again since this industry has been heavily damaged by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to W. Wang et al., “Efficient data transmission based on 5G technology and smart data processing based on AI technology are significant to unlocking IoT-based smart tourism applications” [10]. In addition, this technology can be taken even further and on a larger scale to turn such complex visions like smart cities into reality. Furthermore, R. Ramakrishnan and L. Gaur have claimed that “The IoT of today will extend to cover process, people, products, and other infrastructure to become Internet of Everything (IoE), thereby streamlining the manufacturing process.” [9, p. 154-155]. Moreover, IoT can be developed to make virtual worlds like the Metaverse that Facebook is doing which can be a turning point during the pandemic.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">However, in order to upgrade and bring the Internet of Things to the next level, there are some more compulsory technologies and developments. Firstly, 5G technology is considered to be the most important upgrade that can help humans access more advanced technologies as it is far faster and more effective than recent 4G. According to J. Pisarov and G. Mester, “5G has brought three new aspects – higher speed, lower latency, and connection of multiple devices both as sensors and IoT devices” [11] and “Like other networks, 5G uses the cells system which separates territories into sectors and sends encoded signals between the hotspots using radio waves. Each cell must be connected to the network spine, whether wirelessly or through landlines. 5G works on higher frequencies than 4G, generally on two types of frequencies: bellow and above 6 GHz.” [11]. However, to reach the full potential of 5G technology, technology companies and organizations need an extra period of time for further research and development. Secondly, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are also necessary for IoT to grow since those two fields can make complex things more automated and simpler. In addition, when working with a huge volume of data since larger scale projects will be made, scientists and researchers will need assistance from Data Science.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">It is clear that the Internet of Things is becoming more and more vital and its impact on industries, organizations and our daily lives is inevitably huge, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, IoT combining with other technologies like Artificial Intelligence and 5G can be used to build from home automation, autonomous vehicles to smart cities. As a result, the quality of our lives will be sharply increased and there will be less pollution since exhaust fumes and waste will be strictly managed. Secondly, IoT can improve the supply chain, logistics, and other industries more efficiently by providing more detailed and up-to-date information, which can help companies to come up with more specific and more effective plans to increase their revenue [12]. Thirdly, in the healthcare industry, IoT sensors can be placed inside health monitoring equipment so that the patients’ health statistics can be updated frequently on the Internet for doctors, nurses, and even their families so that the treatment process and methodology will be improved considerably [13]. In addition, as more appliances will become smarter and well-managed by IoT systems, the consumed amount of energy and natural resources will drop, and it will save the environment from pollution and natural resources exhaustion. Most importantly, since the concept of the Internet of Things is interconnectivity, the cybersecurity systems should be generously invested, frequently updated and maintained to prevent personal information leakage, hackers, malwares, etc.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As the coverage of the Internet of Things will get larger over time, there will be more jobs available for people. For instance, technical jobs like developers, engineers that are relevant to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Cybersecurity, and so on will be in high demand. Besides, it is necessary for people doing non-technical jobs to know more about the relevant technologies since they will use those technologies every day in their work. However, there will be fewer opportunities for uneducated or less-educated workers since automation will take over jobs requiring manual labour.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 3. How will this affect you? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">From my perspective, as a student, I am experiencing a few aspects of the Internet of Things in my daily life. For instance, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students have been studying online through many platforms like Canvas, Microsoft Teams, etc. The Internet of Things has supported my studies with online video conferences so that I can join online lectures, ask questions to lecturers, and have nearly the same experience as face-to-face lectures. Besides, there are some other applications that I have experienced as a student such as online health declaration before going to the campus instead of paper declaration, attending online workshops, doing online tests, etc. Therefore, the Internet of Things will improve my daily life considerably and it will change people’s lives if it reaches its full potential. Moreover, there will be a lot of my household appliances will be automated and remotely controlled via the Internet. In addition, since self-drive vehicles will become ubiquitous and the vehicle systems will be kept up-to-date and well managed online, I will no longer experience rush hours and traffic congestions, especially in big cities of Vietnam, which can also reduce a significant amount of carbon dioxide emission to the environment.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The Internet of Things will also provide great support for my family and friends. For instance, household chores will be well done by automated machines which will be controlled online, and family members can have more time for their work and taking care of themselves. Since information will be moved online, my family members can work directly from home. In addition, my friends, university students, can also have a better learning experience, especially those who have to be self-isolated, and they can have the same learning experience as other students. In addition, as the IoT sensors can be compressed into people devices that they use and their health statistics will be constantly updated on the Internet, my family members and my friends can freely keep track of their health and if anything unfortunate happens, it will automatically send emergency signals to hospitals and other family members, so that person can be saved in time. As a result, the Internet of Things can be significantly and undeniably helpful for everyone in society.</p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In the vast world of IT, It is undeniable that Blockchain is the newest amongst the trend of evolving technologies. The discussion about this rising technology has been around recently as Metaverse has been introduced to people worldwide. To define the term “Blockchain technology”, Peter Mell stated in the article of Blockchain Technology Overview: “Blockchains are tamper evident and tamper resistant digital ledgers implemented in a distributed fashion usually without a central authority” [14]. Furthermore, Blockchain are defy as a decentralized transaction and data management technology in 2016 by Jesse Yli-Huumo [15]. In simple words, Blockchain are a technology where all the changes (codes, transactions, information,…) are resistant to tampering. By having no intermediary between transactions and using cryptography, information stored in a block of a blockchain will not be changed or modified by any of the sides.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Blockchain technology was discovered in 2008 along with the birth of Bitcoin. Since then, The technology was mostly linked to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. However, with the rise of Bitcoin and the debut of Metaverse, Blockchain technology are on the rise to be one of the most well-known and dominant IT technologies in the future. As of now, Blockchain are being implied into different industries and become more and more useful to the world. Some applications of Blockchain that are worth mentioned are cryptocurrency, money transferring and most recently, Metaverse.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Currently, Blockchain is being in the phase where it is getting introduced to the audiences and users and is also being developed to become a worldwide sensations/trends. Meta are one of the leading company in bringing Blockchain application into more industries and getting people to be familiar to the technologies.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In the working of a blockchain, An input was modified by a technique called hashing. Sandeep Kumar Panda implies that with hashing, with an input type of whether text, file or image, the output is a fixed size alpha-numeric string [16]. With hashing, Blockchain allow users to transfer data without worry of being changed or tampered. The data which has been hashed will be stored in a block and users need to have a key to access the block. However, the block can only be accessed and cannot be modified or changed. When a person wants to make change to a block, they will have to create another the block which will stored all their modified data. Therefore, the old data will stay untouched.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Due to its security and decentralized features, Blockchain is not only used in just cryptocurrencies but also every transactions that are available online vary from renting a car, online voting to buying real estate and governance. Most recently, Blockchain has been announced to be used in the newest virtual world of Metaverse where people can live in with an avatar of themselves and do every trades/transactions and a wide range of other activities through blockchain technology.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 70px; margin-right: 70px; font-style:italic;">“In general, the most common attraction of the blockchain is cryptocurrency (digital money). Nevertheless, research analysts from the government sector, corporate organizations, security institution as well as industrial segment are able to extend the potential of blockchain and its interests well beyond the domain of cryptocurrencies.” </p>
                                    <p style="text-align: right; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 70px; font-style:italic;">Ahmad Firdaus, “The rise of “blockchain”: bibliometric analysis of blockchain study”, 2019</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">With a rapid rising of popularity and usability, blockchain is surely one a promising technology of the future and will play a major role in the future society.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The impact to humanity of this feature is expected to be massive. Not to mention the changes in other industries, the rising of Bitcoin, Etherium and the NFT, cryptocurrency industry alone is enough to make an impact on the whole world. As a person who always spend time on social media, I am able to witness the rate of appearance of Blockchain discussions are increasing rapidly in the last few years which implies the fact that more and more people are getting interested in Blockchain. Moreover, human life and society are set to be through a massive change as the Metaverse are aiming to change the way human society are functioning. As for now, there has been multiple bloom of various industry in the Metaverse. For example, real estate companies are using the Metaverse platform to run their business or some artworks are being sold on using Blockchain as an NFT. Other than the platform of metaverse, Blockchain technology are being used to protect transactions and record the process for a numerous amount of companies. One of an easy example of blockchain is the personal identity security. According to a report by Sam Daley, approximately 16 million Americans has been suffered with identity fraud and theft in 2017 [17] . However, with the application of Blockchain to store people’s identity, the rate has been reduce drastically. Another usage of Blockchain that are being used more and more by companies is the tracking of logistic works. With Blockchain, the tracking of items’ movement will be unchanged and it will help product providers to scan through the logistic process easier when a problem happens.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 3. How will this affect you? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In my personal perspective, I have not had much experience in the field of cryptocurrency or Blockchain. However, the vast usability and benefit that it provide has attracted me to learn more about the field. Currently, I am learning about cryptocurrency and Blockchain to help me adapt to the trends of fast changing IT industry and the rise of Metaverse. For the last few months, the knowledge of Blockchain has changed my perspective about the both the future and my personal plans. The benefits and fun of blockchain are pushing me to become a blockchain developers which allow me to dive deep into the world of Metaverse and cryptocurrency. Moreover, since I heard about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Etherium, I have been told that it is bad and are capable of ruining people’s life. However, after studying about cryptocurrencies including the risks and benefits of it, I have practically change my thought about the industry. From that, I can see that I will be studying more about the technology, aiming for a good amount of knowledge about the technology in the future.</p>

                                    <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="assets/img/portfolio/1.jpg" alt="..." />
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 1. What does it do? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">The phrase Artificial Intelligence have been used since the 1950s. However, it was not until the 1980 that this term become commonly used. In a simple definition, Artificial Intelligence is the ability that allow computer to process tasks that are similar to human or represent what human are capable of. “If you can put knowledge into a program, then this program must be an AI program”, Roger C. Schank, 1987 [18] . To be more specific, a code are made to solve problems from simple to complex, a simple code solve the problem by follow the guidance of a coder. On the other hand, AI used the technique that are code by the programmers to learn and develop a solution for the problem.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">AI are also divided into three main types which commonly known as artificial narrow intelligence, artificial general intelligence and artificial super intelligence. For artificial narrow intelligence (also known as weak AI), the programmed AI are capable of doing task in one specific field. The artificial general intelligence, on the other hand, are able to perform a much more complicated task which required multiple knowledge from different field. There was a AI robot named Sofia which take the internet by storm by the way it looks and the way it gained a citizenship in Saudi Arabia, the program that made up the intelligence of the robot is what considered as artificial general intelligence (strong AI). The third type of AI – artificial super intelligence – which is also known as Super AI have not been well-implemented into the real world as it is still in developing phase. However, super AI are hoped to be able to complete tasks that human has never been done and its work will be way greater than what humanity are capable of. With the creation of super AI, humanity will be able to reach a greater achievement.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">Nowadays, AI are being used in most of people’s life, its usage are numerous with functionalities vary from personal assistant to even managing a production chain in a factory. A close example of it is the personal assistant that most people interact with everyday is the personal assistant which is a built-in function in people’s phone, computer,…. Even though personal assistants are not common in Vietnam, it has been widely used around the world for a long period of time. Some famous personal assistants are Google assistant, Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri.</p>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">As the demand for AI in daily life are increasing drastically, it is inevitable that AI will become the dominant topic and technology in the near future. As everyone has noticed, AI has already been used in many industries and are spreading more into more fields. However, AI only capable of doing a portion of all the tasks humanity are handling, which create a goal for all AI developers and the AI field to create an AI that can reach a level of intelligence that are capable of completing complex task and be able to take over human’s work, lessening the pressures and works on people’s shoulder.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 2. What is the likely impact? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">AI has been a hot topic and the goal for companies to aim for in a creation of their new products. With that, AI is set to be implied into people’s daily life and is going to be indispensable from human’s life in the future. With AI, human will be capable of doing difficult tasks and solving complex problems. Moreover, AI will reduce labor in many industrialized countries, replacing them with a better working force with. With the help of AI, companies are going to be boosted in their productions and expand their income rates. However, the downside of this, which was predicted several times in the past by the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, is that with the rise of AI, there will be a chance that most human work will be took over by AI, therefore creating a habit of relying on AI. Also, with the AI taking over the work of human, a numerous amount of worker will lose their job which will create labor shortages in several countries, harming that nation economically.</p>
                                    <h4  style = "text-align:left"> 3. How will this affect you? </h4> <br>
                                    <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 30px; color: rgb(87, 87, 87); margin-bottom: 25px;">In a perspective of a future homeowner and a person who interested in AI, not only the rise of AI will not affect me badly but it also create a path for my future plan. I have been enthusiastic about AI for a long time and that is also the reason why I chose to study at RMIT. Therefore, seeing the rise of AI does bring joy to me. Moreover, with AI evolving rapidly, both my and other people’s life will be affected in a good way. For example, our daily routine will be completed much quicker thanks to the help of AI such as making a cup of coffee or doing chores. For me, owning a smart home has been a dream of my own since I was young, and by having to inherit the development of the technology, it will be much easier for me to reach the desired life that I have been aiming for.</p>
